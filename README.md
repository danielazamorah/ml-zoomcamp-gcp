### Theory Notebooks 
[0Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction](nbs/theory/00_intro.ipynb): notebook that covers a quick example to explain what Machine Learning is, goes over the difference between ML and traditional programming, defines Supervised Learning, what the stages in a Machine Learning project are (according to the CRISP-DM methodology), deep dives into the stage of Model Selection, and introduces to important ML tools such as linear algebra, and the Numpy/Pandas libraries. 

[1Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Regression with BigQuery](nbs/theory/01_linear_regression.ipynb): notebook that covers theory + implementation of Linear Regression for the [Car Prices Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset?resource=download) using `bigframes` Pandas DataFrames and BigQuery ML. More about the tool on [BigQuery DataFrames Docs](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest).

### Homework Notebooks 
[0Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction HW](nbs/homework/00_intro_hw.ipynb): notebook where we use pandas and numpy to answer initial questions about the data (null values, unique values, aggregates). Also, we calculate the weights of a linear regression model given some selected columns, rows, and target values.
